{"name":"Zfactor script (Matlab)","tagline":"A script for calculating Z factor (and a way for me to see how GitHub works).","body":"# Short Description\r\nZscipt calculates calculates Z for a simple gas (composed entirely of up to three compounds: methane, ethane and propane), for various Pressures and Temperatures, according to Standing's correlations. \r\n\r\n# Somewhat Longer Description\r\n\r\nUser is asked to provide composition values for C1 (methane), C2 (Ethane) & C3 (propane) and then Z is calculated for a range of temperatures (50-200 F) and pressures (14.7 and 100,200,300...2000 psia). The main output is a plot of Z vs P for four different T (50/100/150/200 F). Secondary output is a table of Z values for the various P & T (see the \"Notes\" section below on how to enable this). Calculations are made according to Standing's correlations.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Notes\r\n- Currently the table is not displayed by default, however this can be changed by removing the percent sign \"%\" from the last line of the script's .m file.\r\n- Oilfield units are assumed, i.e. psia for pressure and Fahrenheit for temperature.\r\n- Composition input should be in decimal form -- do not assume a percent sign (see below). Composition essentially adds up to 1 and not 100.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Example: Composition Input\r\n\r\n - Correct: 0.85\r\n - *False: 85*\r\n - *False: 85 %*\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n## Contact\r\n\r\nDrop me a line on twitter: [@gkampolis](http://twitter.com/gkampolis).\r\nOr find out more on my [site](http://www.gkampolis.com).\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
